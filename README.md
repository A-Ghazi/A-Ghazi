👋 Hi there! I'm Ahmed Al-Nuaimi, an Automotive Engineer with a solid background in Systems Integration, Body Electronics, and Safety Systems Engineering. Over the years, I've worked with top-tier automotive brands like Bentley, VW, Audi, Porsche, and Lamborghini, leading innovative projects and delivering high-quality engineering solutions.

🚗 My experience in the automotive industry has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, systems thinking, and the ability to manage cross-functional projects from concept to production. Now, I’m leveraging this expertise as I transition into Backend Development, where I aim to blend my engineering mindset with software development.

💻 Currently, I’m focused on building my skills in Backend Development using technologies like Python, FastAPI, Django, MySQL, and Docker. I'm passionate about creating robust, scalable, and efficient backend solutions that power dynamic web applications. Alongside this, I’m enhancing my knowledge of frontend technologies like HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

🔧 On my GitHub, you'll find projects that reflect my journey into backend development—ranging from RESTful APIs built with FastAPI and Django to database management using MySQL and containerization with Docker. I'm excited to work on projects that integrate these tools, such as web applications, data-driven platforms, and scalable microservices.

🚀 I am eager to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with fellow developers, and learn from the ever-evolving tech community on GitHub. If you're interested in backend development, Python-based frameworks, or cloud-native applications, let’s connect and create something impactful together!
